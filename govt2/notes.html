<h1> (8/21/19) the political culture, people, and economy of texas</h1>
<ul>
<li>texas is "a state of mind...a mystique closely approximating a religion"</li>
<li>myths about texas (cowboy image, ranchers, wildcatter, independent entrepreneur)</li>
<li>reality of texas today is more complicated</li>
<li>texas is second most populous state</li>
<li>much more diverse than commonly thought</li>
<li>increasing racial and ethnic diversity points to new texas, no longer dominated by republican party</li>
<li><strong>political culture</strong> is broadly shared values, beliefs, and attitudes about how govt + society should function</li>
<li>american pol culture is viewed as emphaziing liberty, equality, democracy</li>
<li>texas is categorized as having a "<strong>traditionalistic individualistic</strong>" <strong>pol culture</strong></li>
<li>moralist says take care of everybody, individualist says everybody takes care of themselves</li>
<li>the one-party state: for over a century, texas was dem, 90s republicans secured control by 2002 with redistricting</li>
<li>texas pol culture was once defined by <strong>provincialism</strong>, a narrow view associated with rural values and notions of limited govt, result was often a self-interested view of the world and intolerance of diversity</li>
<li>texas pol culture defined by dominance of business</li>
<li>labor unions are rare, poorly organized and poorly funded</li>
<li>its a big state</li>
<li>large portion of public lands are in private ownership</li>
<li>the gulf coastal plains: timber production, oil fields, plantation life, urban - dem + suburbs - republican</li>
<li>interior lowlands: agriculture, ranches, conservative</li>
<li>great plains: agriculture, cotton, ranching, petroleum, conservative</li>
<li>basin and range: mountains, little rain, few people, large latino pop, democratic</li>
<li>joseph schumpeter, "creative destruction"</li>
<li>periodic wave of transformation fueled by tech innovations in production and distribution</li>
<li>capitalist process creates new economy, destroys old ones</li>
<li>schumpter's theory provides useful way to think about economic changes that have shaped and reshaped the texas economy</li>
<li><strong>cotton</strong>: cotton is one of the oldest crops grown in texas, cotton production cycles go up and down, 1930 census shows 61% of farmers were tenant farmers and 1/3 of those were sharecroppers, fell throughout great depression, by 1987 only 12% were tenant farmers, one quarter of all US cotton comes from texas</li>
<li><strong>cattle</strong>: history of ranching and cattle industry parallels cotton, industry took off following civil war, neither cotton nor ranching is as important now as it was in the past, in the early 20th century, new technological breakthroughs focused on what lay beneath land, not on it</li>
<li><strong>oil and gas</strong>: oil took off in 1901 with discovery of spindletop oilfield, oil fever for next decade, rise + decline + rise again seen through production figures, major discovery that brought new oil and gas to market lead to a sudden collapse in prices, a boom-and-bust mentality was introduced</li>
<li><strong>oil and gas (continued)</strong>: oil and gas transformed govt + economy, power of govt was expanded through railroad commission, higher education has benefited, oil and gas production is emerging agin in texas economy, which will result in new demands for water supplies and new environmental concerns</li>
<li><strong>high-tech industries</strong>: world oil prices began to collapse in 1982, texas emerged in 80s as leader in high-tech industries, 90s texas went from 7th in nation in total manufacturing employment to 2nd, in 2015 14.34 percent of total output in the state came from manufacturing, and 7.3 percent of the workforce was employed in manufacturing</li>
<li><strong>NAFTA</strong>: in 1992 the <strong>North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)</strong> was signed which created a free-trade zone among the US, Canada, and Mexico, texas exports increased, although there were some NAFTA losers, there were also big winners</li>

<h1> (8/26/19)</h1>
<ul>
<li>three factors account for population growth in texas
<ol>
	<li>natural increase (births)</li>
	<li>international immigration</li>
	<li>domestic immigration</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>texas's population in 2017 was estimated to be over 28 mil</li>
<li><strong>whites (anglos)</strong>: for most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, dom ethnic group was non-hispanic whites; first wave was encouraged by <strong>empresarios</strong> such as moses austin + son stephen f. austin; as a percentage of the population, white pop peaked at 74% in 1950; percentage began to fall, reaching 43.5% in 2015, will likely continute to fall</li>
<li><strong>latinos</strong>: most latinos in texas are of mexican descent; until 1900, latinos were concentrated in south texas, by 2000, latinos constituted majorities in san antonio + el paso and sizable minorities in other cities; political status of latinos in texas has changed considerably over the past 100 years; number of latinos elected to public office rose from 1466 (1986) to 2521 (2011)</li>
<li><strong>latinos (continued)</strong>: political status has changed considerably over the past 100 years; white-only primary and the <strong>poll tax</strong> actively discouraged voting by latinos; in 1956, henry b gonzalez became first mexi american to be elected to texas senate in modern times; la raza unida party emerged in mid-1960s</li>
<li><strong>african americans</strong>: people of african descent were among earliest explorers in texas; most african americans, however, entered the state as slaves; mexican authorities' antislavery attitudes kept the black population relatively low (5000 in 1830) until texas revolution and expansion of slavery; emancipation (june 19, 1865) did not bring anything approaching equality</li>
<li><strong>african americans (continued)</strong>: black codes restricted rights of former slaves; federal court cases in 40s + 50s offered some hope of relief; civil rights act (64) + voting rights (65) helped open political system to african americans; in 72 barbara jordan became first african american woman to be elected to the us house of representatives from texas</li>
<li><strong>asians</strong>: in 2017, us census bureau estimated over 1 mil asians resided in texas (5% of state pop)</li>
<li><strong>age</strong>: pop of texas is relatively young in comparison with rest of nation; in 2015, 27.3% of pop was estimated to be under 18yrs old, compared with 24% nationally</li>
<li><strong>poverty and wealth</strong>: despite growth of the 90s, incomes in texas have lagged behind those of nation as a whole</li>
<li><strong>urbanization</strong>: much of texas's history is linked to ongoing <strong>urbanization</strong>; by the 21st century, the process of urbanization was largely complete; now 85% of pop resides in urban areas; urbanization and accompanying suburbanization are the forces driving politics in modern texas</li>
<li><strong>houston</strong>: houston is largest city in texas, with a pop of 2.1 mil, it is the fourth largest city in the us; it is the second- or third- busiest deep-water port in the us (depending on which ranking is used); oil fundamentally transformed the houston area and made houston one of the leading energy centers int he world</li>
<li><strong>dallas-fort worth</strong>: the metroplex consists of dallas, fort worth, and a number of other suburban cities; with the discovery of oil in east texas in 1930, dallas became a major center for petroleum financing; dallas looks to east and embodies a more corporate culture; fort worth looks west and since the two world wars has emerged as the home of a large aviation industry</li>
<li><strong>san antonio</strong>: san antonio is texas's second-largest city; san antonio's population increasingly latino; san antonio lacks high-paying manufacturing jobs, average metropolitan income is lower than in houston and dallas; economy rests on national military bases, educational institutions, tourism, and a large medical research complex</li>
<li><strong>austin</strong>: as the state capital, austin is the hub for government business; it is the fourth-largest metropolitan area in texas; austin is the location of the university of texas at austin - the flagship institution of the university of texas system; austin has a thriving high-tech industry; austin's per capita income and median household income are both greater than their corresponding state averages</li>
<li>economy and people of texas have becme diversified</li>
<li>texas has become a melting pot of cultures and concerns</li>
<li>future of texas likely will continue to be defined by economic and demographic changes
<ul>
<li>latinos will play an increasingly important role in the economic and political life of texas</li>
<li>president trump's call to reevaluate nafta may change texas's connection with the world economy</li>
</ul>

<h1>(8/28/19) federalism</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>us v lopez</strong>: congress passes gun free school zones act (1990); made it illegal to possess a gun in a school zone, or within 1000 feet; passed by democrat congress, signed into law by george h.w. bush; alfonso lopez jr., high school senior who was charged under texas law first for possessing a handgun and bullets at san antonio high school (march 1992)</li>
<li><strong>us v lopez (background)</strong>: state charges were dropped after federal charges filed; convicted in federal district court; court ruled congress had power to regulate the "business" of elementary, middle, and high schools; fifth circuit court of appeals overturns the decision; claims law is unconstitutional based on commerce clause; us argued the act was constitutional because buying and selling guns and associated illicit activities affect interstate commerce; gun violence in schools leads to both more dangerous and thus less commercially healthy neighborhoods and less economically productive kids; supreme court rules 5-4 in favor of lopez</li>
<li><strong>william rehnquist majority opinion</strong>: "the act neither regulates a commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be connected in any way to interstate commerce"; commerce can be regulated by the federal government if it falls in any of three broad categories:
<ul>
<li>use of channels of interstate commerce</li>
<li>instrumentalities of interstate commerce</li>
<li>activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce</li>
</ul>
immediately tosses out the first two possibilities; the law does not regulate channels or instrumentalities of interstate commerce; leaves only the possibility of substantial relation to interstate congress; rehnquist notes the court has done a good job at describing what commerce is, but admits the court has done a poor job at defining interstate commerce</li>
<li><strong>are guns at school commerce?</strong>: government argument is that possession of a firearm may increase violent crime and violent crime affects the national economy in two ways:
<ul>
<li>violent crime increases insurance rates, which affect everyone in the population</li>
<li>violent crime makes people less willing to travel to unsafe areas</li>
</ul>
also argues that guns in school lead to poor education, which in turn produces less productive citizens</li>
<li><strong>why is is not commerce?</strong>: the "cost of crime" argument, if that holds true, then congress can regulate anything that could potentially lead to crime; "national productivity" argument, if that holds true, congress can regulate any activity it feels affects economic productivity; both education and criminal law are constitutionally protected areas of state sovereignty; "if we were to accept the government's arguments, we are hard presses to posit any activity by an individual that congress is without popwer to regulate"</li>
<li><strong>justice breyer dissent</strong>: the gfsza does fall under commerce clause because the court must not consider an individual instance, but the effect of guns at every school; supreme court should also defer to congress' authority by not basing the decision on if the "regulated activity sufficiently affected interstate commerce", but if congress had a rational basis to think it would; several studies indicate that violent crime lowers economic output and crime in schools lowers educational outcomes</li>
<li><strong>effects on federal-state relations</strong>: the first supreme court decision since the great depression to limit congress' commerce clause power; reaffirms constitutional provision that certain powers are reserved to the states; signals to states a change in the court's federalism jurisprudence</li>
<li><strong>elazar's three factors</strong>: three factors drive how each state derives their individual factors
<ol>
<li>political culture: the particular pattern of orientation to political action in which the political system is embedded</li>
<li>frontier: the constant effort of americans to extend their control over their environment for human benefit</li>
<li>sectionalism: the more or less permanent ties that link together groups of contiguous states or segments of states with bonds of shared interests</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>power versus justice</strong>: there are two poles of government
<ol>
<li>power is "who gets what, when, and how"; civil society</li>
<li>justice is the desire to become a good society</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>the four tendencies</strong>
<ol>
<li>efficiency: getting results in the least wasteful manner, minimizing expenses</li>
<li>commerce: exchange of ideas, goods, and services</li>
<li>legitimacy: underlying values of the citizenry</li>
<li>agrarianism: self-governing freeholders, general diffusion of knowledge, religion, and morality</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>three political cultures</strong>:
<ol>
<li>individualistic: government should not be concerned with the good society; limit interaction by government into private activities; politicians are treated as "business" people; political parties then become "business corporations"; this promotes professional politicians</li>
<li>moralistic: politics main goal should be the good society; politics is a public activity centered on the public good; social issues tend to be the focal point; politicians should build relationships and loyalties; parties are useful, not necessary; promotes amateur politician instead of professional</li>
<li>traditionalistic: government is paternalistic and elitist; confines political power to a small ruling class; citizens are only expected to be minimally active in politics; politicians first responsibility is to themselves and their family; political parties are virtually nonexistent, or one-party dominant</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>frontiers</strong>: america has always sought new frontiers; "the conquest of one frontier has led to the opening of another"; rural-land frontier, settling the land, agricultural based; urban-industrial frontier: urbanization and manufacturing; metropolitan-technological frontier: suburbanization and new technology</li>
<li><strong>sectionalism</strong>: "sections are not homogeneous socioeconomic units sharing a common character across state lines"; set of common political interests that allow coordination on both social and economic issues; differs from regionalism; regionalism represents a common interest over specific single issue; sections continue to have intra-sectional conflict, but overall have strong sectional bonds on national issues</li>
</ul>

<h1>(9/4/19) the texas constitution</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>why the texas constitution matters</strong>: the texas constitution is a legal framework with which the govt works; rights guaranteed in the texas constitution go beyond those of the us constitution; texas constitution has an immediate and enormous impact on citizens' everyday lives, perhaps even more than the us constitution; the length and detail of the texas constitution make the amendment process central to the political process; voter approval is necessary for proposed amendments</li>
<li><strong>the role of a state constitution</strong>: state <strong>constitutions</strong> perform a number of important functions; establish political institutions and explain the source of their power and authority; delegate powers to particular institutions and individuals and define how those powers are to be used; responsible for establishment of local govts; protect against concentration of pol power in one institution or individual; define limits of pol power</li>
<li><strong>texas's constitution is heavily influenced by us one</strong>: political power is derived from the people; both constitutions feature a <strong>separation of powers</strong>, legislative, executive, judicial; a system of <strong>checks and balances</strong> limits the power of each branch, as a way to protect against <strong>tyranny</strong>; certain <strong>individual rights</strong> must not be violated such as freedom of speech, assembly, religion, etc; the idea of <strong>federalism</strong> is also embodied in the constitutions of the us and texas</li>
<li><strong>important differences btwn us and texas constitution</strong>: <strong>supremacy clause</strong> us const and federal laws are supreme law of land; <strong>necessary and proper clause</strong> the federal govt has all authority it needs to carry out its powers, drafters of texas consts have been unwilling to grant the govt this level of discretionary power; texas const guarantees other rights, not found in the us const, such as the right to have an "efficient system of public free schools"</li>
</ul>
